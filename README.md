# Noted. 
Created by students, for students.  We are an innovative education platform designed to revolutionise how we approach learning. Our goal? To redefine how students connect with knowledge, enabling them to achieve their full potential through a smarter and more intuitive approach to studying. We create engaging and personalised YouTube videos to help students study with a simple click of the camera. The best part is, we wonâ€™t just be limited to YouTube videos. In due time, users will be able to effortlessly transform notes into personalized Spotify podcasts, and study efficiently on the go. We will also allow notes to be seamlessly converted into engaging Instagram Reels and TikTok videos, making learning more interactive, fun, and shareable. At Noted., our motto is to help students study smarter, not harder.
